						<p>I'm second year Master's Mechanical Engineering student. I studied Mechanical Engineering in undergrad at 
							UC Davis and also minored in Computer Science. My engineering interests include mechanical design, control systems, and 
							mechatronics.<br />To the right, you will find my extracurriculars and hobbies.

											I love exploring and learning new things. I think that's what makes me love engineering.
											One of my hobbies is hiking as it's a great destressor and always a fun way to explore new places!
											Seen above I am trying my best not to fall in the river, where the ice cold Icelandic waters await.

												I am part of the only co-ed engineering fraternity on the UC Davis campus.
												They are my home away from home and have pushed me to greater heights both personally and professionally.
												I continue to give back through taking on several leadership roles that have taught me time management skills, 
												teamwork, conflict resolution, and delegation.

												One of my greatest passions that I have repurposed into my engineering journey is my love for reading and writing. 
												Specifically, I enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi novels, and I enjoy writing short stories and attempting novels. 
												I think it takes a certain kind of imagination to dream up of an entirely new world with unique characters and back stories.
												This sort of creativity is something that I held dear in my childhood writing all sorts of stories and poems, and I believe
												it has grown and inspired me in my engineering endeavors.

											With quarantine and the increased freedom of grad school, I found myself taking upon the hobby of houseplants. Since I am 
											home all the time, why not try to make my surroundings look a bit nicer? Well it started with one plant, and then, one plant 
											became three plants...which became 25 plants. I think there's something exciting about watching your plants grow right 
											before you, from just some sun, water, and love. I always send new leaf pictures to all my friends and document the process 
											as a new leaf unfurls. It's surprisingly low maintenance and has been teaching me some much needed patience (semi-protip: more 
											fertilizer does NOT make a happy plant). There are so many species of plants out there that look almost unreal sometimes, and 
											growing my plant family is honestly one of the most rewarding things that I've discovered during covid times.

											Let me stop you before you think, "Aren't they ridiculously annoying though? Why would I want to work with her?" There is 
											SO much more to mechanical keyboards than your standard Razer gamer keyboard that glows like a rainbow and clicks away like 
											you're shaking a jar of LEGOs. The customizability of mechanical keyboards is what drew me in. I was skeptical at first. I 
											thought my standard laptop keyboard was fine, got the job done. Little did I know that I was ignoring a whole new typing experience.
											Mechanical keyboards are some of the smoothest keys I've typed on, almost like you are typing on clouds. And they don't always come 
											in that clicky variety. There are silent switches that sound so muffled you can barely hear that you are typing. I love the typing experience 
											but I also love the creative space mechanical keyboards provide. If you ever wished your keyboard had just that shade of green with 
											just that specific shade of orange, you can make it happen or it may even have been done before. Building keyboards is relatively 
											simple as well, but it has that relaxing effect of doing repetitive tasks (soldering the switches, putting on the keycaps over and over).
											Ultimately, it was just trying something new and loving it that drew me in to this hobby.

												While many might not term this a "hobby" per se, I believe one of the things I love to do is try new things! 
												I am always open to new experiences, and many times saying yes to something new that may be intimidating has turned
												out amazing! Some examples include deciding to study abroad in Iceland for a summer, going to various cultural and food 
												fairs with friends, travelling to Oregon to watch the eclipse, and (seen above) attending a lights festival.

											At my internship with IDEX Health and Science, I conducted a Design of Experiement (DOE) model.
											The primary goal was to examine and find trends within torque data retrieved from valves varying in
											pressure rating and rotor seal material. In total, 30 valves were tested with 5 in each independent group.
											Trends from the data recorded were presented to key engineers in the Analytical Instruments and Advanced Systems
											Development teams. The analytical data can be used to facillitate future valve designs for various consumer needs.

											After following a series of ANSI working drawings, I created all the individual components of a 
											gyroscope in SolidWorks and assembled it. Using this understanding of the gyroscrope, I utilized
											my campus's machine shop to fabricate each component using the bandsaw, drill press, lathe, mill, and CNC 
											machine. Afterward, I assembled the parts and test it as shown above.

											Another project I undertook during my internship with IDEX Health and Science was the  design and prototyping
											of a fixture for a pump. After taking measurements of the machine it was to be embedded in and
											discussing several designs with the engineers, I created an initial design to be shown to the head engineer.
											I then prototyped the design using aluminum sheet metal in the company's machine shop. Through manufacturing
											the design, I became aware of potential pitfalls in mass production of this design.
											To streamline the process, I revised my design to be symmetrical for easier fabrication.
											The design was later approved and officially ordered for assembly in the final machine.

											I participated in the Biomedical Engineering Society's annual Make-a-Thon competition. The prompt consisted of 
											designing a device to aid users with physical and/or visual impairments
											accurately and comfortably dispense eye drops. 
											The design my team finalized was an automated system in which a spring-loaded one-stop eyedropper holder
											has a microcontrolled piston that compresses the eyedropper to dispense precisely one drop at a time.
											An ergonomic design coupled with a grip allows for increased dexterity for consumers, and an anti-blinking 
											system eliminates the problem in which users frequently blink when anticipating the drop to fall.
											My role in this project was the CAD designer. I collaborated with a peer of mine in the design of the individual
											components and final assembly of the device.

											In my Embedded Systems Design course, I was given a TI CC3200 LaunchPad to proram using Code Composer Studio and learn more 
											about the communication of electronic devices and the modules used in real-time embedded systems. This included
											labs that utilized Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Trasmitters (UART), Serial Peripheral Interfaces, Inter-integrated 
											circuits, ADCs, timers, and Interrupt Handlers. 
											Key projects was include creating a simple audio interface in which the embedded system would decode
											dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) audio signals and use the input to compose messages that would print on an
											OLED screen which could be sent to a connected LaunchPad through a UART communication channel. Another
											project was utilizing RESTful API to securely connect to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and send and retrieve data from 
											the AWS cloud. This was linked the AWS IoT Service so that a message composed on the board would be sent to the cloud
											and then sent through SMS to a given phone number.
